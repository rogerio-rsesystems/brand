| Jun 2026 | **"What Happens Next" step 02** | "A member of our team reaches out to schedule a discovery call" — NOT "Rogerio personally." Company-first, institutional, scalable language. |

---

| Jun 2026 | **Section order** | Why We Exist → Agency Model → Founder → Multilingual → Career Timeline → CTA |

## Phase 4 — Visual Identity & Higgsfield AI Production ✏️ Planned

### Decision: Use Higgsfield AI for Corporate Visual Production

| Date | Decision | Detail |
|------|----------|--------|
| Jun 2026 | **Platform: Higgsfield AI** | Selected for corporate animation and image generation. Higgsfield specializes in cinematic video generation, motion effects, and professional corporate imagery — appropriate for a boutique consulting brand. |
| Jun 2026 | **Goal** | Elevate the site from professional text-heavy to visually compelling. Corporate imagery and subtle animations will differentiate RG from competitors whose sites are primarily text and stock photography. |
| Jun 2026 | **Tone** | Executive. Cinematic. Navy + Gold color grading to match brand. No generic office stock. Think: boardrooms, data visualizations, integration war rooms, global deal maps. |
| Jun 2026 | **Hero section priority** | The Hero slideshow is the highest-priority visual upgrade. Currently uses 4 Unsplash stock photos with navy overlay. Replace with Higgsfield-generated branded cinematic images or subtle looping animations. |
| Jun 2026 | **Services sections priority** | Each service sub-page hero should have a bespoke visual — PMI should feel different from AI Readiness should feel different from Project Management. |

### Higgsfield Setup Steps (Pre-Production Checklist)

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Create Higgsfield account** | https://higgsfield.ai — sign up with professional email |
| 2 | **Select plan** | Review Pro vs. Studio tier — Studio recommended for commercial use and full resolution exports |
| 3 | **Download brand kit** | From brand repo: `logo.png.png`, `logo-white-transparent.png`, Montserrat + Inter fonts, hex values: Navy `#1B2A4A`, Gold `#C8A84B` |
| 4 | **Headshot prep** | Export Rogerio headshot at high resolution for any Higgsfield portrait animations |
| 5 | **Prompt library** | Build a set of reusable prompt templates (see planned asset list below) before starting generation to ensure visual consistency |
| 6 | **Color grading brief** | All outputs: cool dark tones, navy shadows, gold accent light sources. Avoid warm/orange tones. Cinematic widescreen (16:9). |
| 7 | **Export format** | Video: MP4 (H.264), max 10 seconds for web. Images: PNG or WebP, minimum 1920×1080. |
| 8 | **Asset naming** | Follow pattern: `hf-[section]-[variant]-[vN].mp4` e.g. `hf-hero-boardroom-v1.mp4`, `hf-services-pmi-v1.png` |

### Planned Asset List

#### Hero Section (Highest Priority)
| Asset ID | Description | Format | Placement |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| `hf-hero-01` | Executive boardroom, dark navy atmosphere, subtle light movement | MP4 loop or PNG | Hero slide 1 |
| `hf-hero-02` | Global deal map / network of connected nodes, gold accent lines | MP4 loop or PNG | Hero slide 2 |
| `hf-hero-03` | Data transformation visualization — fragmented data becoming unified | MP4 loop or PNG | Hero slide 3 |
| `hf-hero-04` | Corporate handshake / deal close moment, cinematic framing | PNG | Hero slide 4 |

#### Services Sub-Pages (Each page gets a unique hero visual)
| Asset ID | Service | Description | Format |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `hf-svc-pmi` | Post-Merger Integration | Two org charts merging into one, Day 1 countdown board | PNG or MP4 |
| `hf-svc-ai` | AI Readiness | Data silos breaking apart and flowing into a unified stream | PNG or MP4 |
| `hf-svc-digital` | Digital Transformation | Legacy stack dissolving into cloud architecture | PNG or MP4 |
| `hf-svc-bizxform` | Business Transformation | Strategy pyramid being built, executive team in silhouette | PNG |
| `hf-svc-pm` | Project Management | Gantt chart / program dashboard, controlled execution energy | PNG |

#### About Page
| Asset ID | Description | Format | Placement |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| `hf-about-01` | Rogerio headshot animated — subtle professional motion effect | MP4 | About hero panel |
| `hf-about-02` | Global map with Latin America + North America highlighted in gold | PNG | About geography section |

#### General / Reusable
| Asset ID | Description | Format | Placement |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| `hf-og-default` | Default Open Graph image — navy bg, gold logo, tagline | PNG 1200×630 | og:image meta tag |
| `hf-og-services` | Services OG image | PNG 1200×630 | Services page og:image |
| `hf-og-contact` | Contact page OG image | PNG 1200×630 | Contact page og:image |

### Implementation Notes for Claude (when Phase 4 begins)

- All Higgsfield assets stored in `/public/media/` folder in the website repo
- Hero slideshow in `Home.jsx` currently uses `backgroundImage: url(...)` inline CSS — update to reference `/media/hf-hero-*.png` or convert to `<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline>` for MP4 animations
- Service sub-page heroes currently use CSS `background: #1B2A4A` — update to use `hf-svc-*` assets as background images with the existing navy overlay preserved (opacity ~0.7 so text remains legible)
- About.jsx headshot section: if using animated headshot, swap `<img>` for `<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline>` with poster fallback to static headshot
- OG images: update `<meta property="og:image">` in each page's `<Helmet>` block
- Performance: all video assets must be compressed to under 5MB for web. Images: use WebP format with PNG fallback.
- Lazy loading: service sub-page hero images should use `loading="lazy"` to not block initial page render

### Phase 4 Exit Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Higgsfield account created and plan selected
- [ ] All hero assets (hf-hero-01 through 04) generated, approved, and committed
- [ ] All 5 service page visuals generated and deployed
- [ ] About page animated headshot or geography visual in place
- [ ] 3 OG images generated (default, services, contact)
- [ ] All assets compressed, WebP-converted, and committed to `/public/media/`
- [ ] Mobile performance verified — no layout shift, no loading delay
- [ ] Rogerio final visual approval before Phase 5

## Known Issues — Logged June 9, 2026

| # | Issue | Priority | Phase |
|---|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Mobile responsiveness broken** | 🔴 HIGH | Pre-launch — fix before go-live. All pages need mobile CSS review. Grid layouts collapse incorrectly on narrow viewports (<768px). Affects all pages built in Phase 2 and 3. |
| 2 | **Client portal dark theme** | 🟡 MED | Phase 6 (Client Portal rebuild). Login page, ClientDashboard, ClientProjects, DocumentPortal all use old dark gray Tailwind theme from v1.4. Rebuild to Navy+Gold brand system when portal is rebuilt in Phase 6. |
| 3 | **Admin portal dark theme** | 🟡 MED | Phase 6. AdminDashboard and AdminProjects use old dark Tailwind theme. AdminInsights was built new (Navy+Gold). Standardize all admin pages to match AdminInsights style when portal is rebuilt. |
| 4 | **Firestore articles permissions** | 🔴 FIXED | Firestore rules required `users_roles` admin document before allowing article writes. Fixed June 9 — rule now also checks `request.auth.token.email` directly for admin emails. Deploy with `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`. |

## Session 4 Decisions & Fixes — June 9, 2026

### Mobile Responsiveness ✅ Complete

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Approach** | Shared `useIsMobile()` hook at `src/hooks/useIsMobile.js` — watches window resize, returns boolean at 768px breakpoint |
| **Scope** | 14 files updated: Home, About, Contact, Services, Portfolio, Insights, CaseStudyDetail, ArticleDetail, Footer, Navbar, all 5 service sub-pages |
| **Grid rules** | 2-col → 1-col on mobile. 3-col → 1-col. 4-col → 2-col. Content+sidebar → stacked. |
| **Padding** | Section padding reduced 80px → 48px on mobile. Form cards 40px → 16px. |
| **Sticky sidebars** | Disabled on mobile — position switches to static |
| **Contact page** | Hardcoded `1fr 340px` grid fixed to `isMobile ? '1fr' : '1fr 340px'`. Form stacks above sidebar on mobile. Confirmed working. |

### Auth Pages Rebranded ✅

| Page | Change |
|------|--------|
| `/login` — ClientLogin.jsx | Full rebrand: dark gray → Navy+Gold white card, RG logo at top, brand typography, gold links |
| `/forgot-password` — ForgotPassword.jsx | Same rebrand treatment. Clean, consistent with public site. |
| ClientSignup.jsx | Still old dark theme — deferred to Phase 7 (Client Portal rebuild) |

### Insights Blog — Issues Fixed ✅

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Firestore permissions error on publish | Firestore rules updated — articles writable by `admin@rgenterpriseconsulting.com` and `rogerio@rgenterpriseconsulting.com` directly via `request.auth.token.email` check. No `users_roles` doc required. |
| "Loading articles" forever on public page | Removed composite index requirement — now fetches all articles and filters client-side |
| Publish button saving as draft | Fixed setState race condition — status passed directly to `handleSave(status)` as parameter |
| Markdown rendering | Added `marked.js` — full Markdown support: headings, bold, italic, lists, links, images, blockquotes, tables, code blocks |
| Paste & auto-convert | Claude API converts any pasted text/HTML to clean Markdown in ~5 seconds |
| First article published | DaimlerChrysler PMI case study live at /insights |

## Careers Feature ✅ Built — June 2026

| Decision | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Platform** | Built on same Firebase stack — Firestore for positions/applications, Storage for resumes, Functions for email |
| **Admin write** | /admin/careers — post/edit/close positions with full Markdown JD. Same pattern as Insights admin. |
| **Public listing** | /careers — open positions card list. Empty state with direct email CTA. |
| **Job detail page** | /careers/[slug] — Markdown JD rendered, LinkedIn Share in hero, sticky application form |
| **Application form** | Name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL, resume upload (PDF/Word max 5MB), optional cover note |
| **Resume storage** | Firebase Storage — resumes/ folder. Download URL stored in Firestore applications collection. |
| **Notification email** | Sent to talent@rgenterpriseconsulting.com with all candidate details + gold Download Resume button |
| **Auto-reply** | Sent to candidate with reference number (RGE-APP-XXXXXX) and confirmation |
| **Firebase Function** | sendApplicationEmail — deployed alongside sendContactEmail in functions/index.js |
| **Firestore rules** | positions: open ones public-readable, admin-writable. applications: anyone can create (submit), admin-readable only. |
| **Navigation** | Careers added to both navbar and footer |
| **LinkedIn workflow** | Each job page has LinkedIn Share button. URL posted on LinkedIn auto-pulls og:title and og:description from meta tags. |
| **Reference number format** | RGE-APP-XXXXXX (6-digit timestamp suffix) |
| **Talent email** | talent@rgenterpriseconsulting.com — must be created as Ionos mailbox before go-live |

### Pre-Launch: Create Talent Email
Before going live, create `talent@rgenterpriseconsulting.com` as an Ionos mailbox. Same process as `leads@rgenterpriseconsulting.com`. Otherwise application notifications will bounce.

## Careers Feature — Issues Fixed & Final State (June 2026)

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Careers page blank | Route `/careers` was imported but never added to App.jsx Routes | Added public routes `/careers` and `/careers/:slug` |
| Login page hanging | `setLoading(false)` ran after successful login but `useEffect` navigated away first — button stayed disabled forever | `setLoading(false)` now only runs on error, not on success |
| Resume upload CORS error | Firebase Storage bucket didn't exist yet, then CORS rules weren't set | Created Storage bucket in Firebase Console, ran `gcloud storage buckets update` with cors.json |
| Resume upload permission denied | No `storage.rules` file existed — Firebase defaulted to deny all | Created storage.rules allowing public PDF/Word uploads under 5MB to resumes/ folder |
| Sign Out missing from admin | No logout button existed in AdminDashboard | Added red Sign Out button — logs out and redirects to /login |
| CSP blocking Firestore | index.html CSP missing `firebasestorage.googleapis.com`, `securetoken.googleapis.com`, `*.firestore.googleapis.com` | Updated CSP in index.html to include all required Firebase domains |

### Security Rules — Final State

| Surface | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Storage resumes/ | Public create: PDF/Word only, max 5MB, no overwrites. Read/delete: authenticated only. |
| Firestore applications | Public create with field validation (must have fullName, email, positionId, size limits). Read: admin only. |
| Firestore articles | Published status readable publicly. Drafts: admin only. |
| Firestore positions | Public read (for listing). Write: admin only. |
| Firestore leads/meta | Completely locked — Firebase Functions only. |
| Everything else | Default deny. |

### Careers Feature — Confirmed Working
- Admin posts position at /admin/careers → appears in Firestore `positions` collection
- Public sees position at /careers → clicks → /careers/[slug] with full JD
- Applicant fills form, uploads PDF resume → Firebase Storage `resumes/` folder
- Application saved to Firestore `applications` collection
- Email notification sent to talent@rgenterpriseconsulting.com with download link
- Auto-reply sent to applicant with reference number
- LinkedIn Share button on each job page

## Phase 4 — Visual Identity & Site Beautification (June 2026)

### Hero Redesign — Approved & Implemented

| Decision | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Headshot removed from homepage** | Headshot completely removed from hero — firm-first brand |
| **Hero background** | Animated canvas: gold circuit grid lines + travelling signal pulses. Nodes pulse at grid intersections. Rotating dashed rings orbit the logo center. |
| **Hero logo** | `logo-white-transparent.png` — 442px, opacity 15%, CSS filter `invert(1) sepia(1) saturate(0)` = pure white ghost. Gentle float animation (4s sine wave). |
| **Logo direction rejected** | Wireframe/outline SVG rejected — `FinalCorrigido.svg` confirmed as raster PNG embedded in SVG shell (no vector paths). True outline not technically possible without original .ai/.eps file. |
| **Logo watermark rationale** | Logo is decorative support element, not competing with headline. Left side (text) is the primary message. |
| **Glow/rings** | Canvas draws 3 pulsing gold rings + 2 rotating dashed rings around logo center — animated energy without altering the logo itself |
| **How We Work section** | 3 Unsplash photos at full visibility below fold (between Trusted By and Services). M&A Integration / AI & Digital / Transformation. Gold tag badges. Approved. |
| **"Senior Practitioners" text** | Corrected — removed false claim about senior-only staffing. New copy: "Every RGE engagement is staffed with experienced professionals committed to delivery. We don't just advise — we execute alongside your team and own the outcomes." |
| **Track Record section** | Removed from About page — too personally focused on Rogerio, not firm-first |

### Inner Page Heroes — Each Unique

| Page | Visual Treatment | Headline |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Services | Interconnected node graph SVG (background, 6% opacity) | "Enterprise Services. Built to Execute." |
| About | Globe/longitude lines SVG watermark — communicates global reach | "The Firm Behind Every Program We Lead." |
| Portfolio | Rising bar chart elements (bottom-right, 8% opacity) | "Real Programs. Measurable Outcomes." |
| Insights | Horizontal editorial rule lines (4% opacity) | "Perspectives From Practitioners Who Lead." |
| Careers | Globe arc with dashed flight path + city dots | "Work on Programs That Actually Matter." |
| Contact | Diagonal gold accent lines (right side, 6% opacity) | "Your Toughest Challenge Deserves a Real Answer." |

All heroes: navy `#1B2A4A`, gold `#C8A84B`, Montserrat 800 headlines, consistent eyebrow pattern.

### Contact Page — Full Conversion Redesign

| Element | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| **Hero layout** | Split — headline + 3 trust badges left, proof strip ($30M+/15yr/3 continents/24h) right |
| **Trust badges** | ⚡ 24h response guarantee · 🔒 Strictly confidential · 🤝 No pitch — just a conversation |
| **Photo strip** | Same 3 Unsplash cards as homepage How We Work section — replaces redundant dark text strip |
| **Step micro-copy** | Reassuring one-liner under each step title explaining why we ask |
| **Sidebar** | "What Happens Next" upgraded: numbered circles with gold borders + subtitle per step |
| **Calendly strategy** | Calendly LOCKED behind form submission — zero Calendly links visible anywhere on site before form is filled |
| **Calendly CTA** | Appears ONLY on thank-you screen after submission + in confirmation email to submitter |
| **Navbar CTA** | "Schedule a Call" → points to /contact (not Calendly directly) |
| **About page CTA** | Points to /contact |
| **Rationale** | Forces every prospect to submit form first — Rogerio enters every Calendly call fully briefed |

### Careers Page Improvements

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Hero globe arc | SVG globe with dashed flight path arc — communicates cross-border work |
| Icon upgrade | Emoji icons in "Why RGE" cards replaced with proper inline SVG icons |
| Hero copy | "Work on Programs That Actually Matter." |

## Lead Intelligence System — Phase 4 (June 2026)

### Architecture

| Component | Location | Editable Without Code |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| Numeric scoring weights | `functions/index.js` `scoreLead()` | ❌ Requires code edit |
| Free email domain list | `functions/index.js` `FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS[]` | ❌ Requires code edit |
| High-risk country list | `functions/index.js` `HIGH_RISK_COUNTRIES[]` | ❌ Requires code edit |
| AI analysis prompt | Firestore `config/leadIntelligencePrompt` | ✅ Admin UI at /admin/prompt |

### Lead Scoring — Quantitative (scoreLead function)

| Signal | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Budget $150K+ | +25 |
| Budget $75K-$150K | +20 |
| Budget $25K-$75K | +12 |
| Budget Under $25K | +5 |
| Timeline ASAP | +25 |
| Timeline 1-3 months | +20 |
| Timeline 3-6 months | +12 |
| Timeline Just exploring | +5 |
| Company 1000+ employees | +20 |
| Company 201-1000 | +16 |
| Company 51-200 | +10 |
| Company 1-50 | +5 |
| CEO/President/Owner | +15 |
| COO/CTO/CFO | +14 |
| VP/Vice President | +12 |
| Director | +10 |
| Manager/Head of | +7 |
| Analyst/Associate | +3 |
| Company website provided | +10 |
| Phone number provided | +5 |
| Free email (gmail etc.) | −10 |
| High-risk country origin | −20 |
| VPN/Proxy detected | −15 |

Score labels: 🔥 HOT (75+) · ⚡ WARM (50+) · ❄️ COLD (25+) · 👀 UNSCORED

### IP Intelligence (ip-api.com)
- Country name + country code on every submission
- ISP/network provider identified
- Proxy/VPN detection
- High-risk country flag (27 countries listed in code)
- Local/dev IPs automatically skipped

### Free Email Detection
Domains flagged: gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com, live.com, aol.com, icloud.com, me.com, msn.com, ymail.com, protonmail.com, mail.com, zoho.com, gmx.com, inbox.com

### AI Intelligence — Claude Analysis (qualitative)
Claude analyzes every submission across 5 dimensions and returns structured JSON:
1. **Email domain** — corporate vs free, domain-to-company match
2. **Job title** — seniority, economic buyer vs influencer vs researcher
3. **Geographic risk** — country, proxy/VPN, high-risk flag with explicit warning
4. **Content** — free-text fields analyzed for authenticity, coherence, specificity
5. **Company** — known context, legitimacy check, size/industry match

Output fields: `credibilityScore` (0-100), `credibilityRating`, `emailAnalysis`, `titleAnalysis`, `geoRiskAnalysis`, `contentAnalysis`, `companyAnalysis`, `redFlags[]`, `greenFlags[]`, `recommendedAction`, `actionRationale`, `openingTalkingPoint`

Recommended actions: `CALL_TODAY` / `FOLLOW_UP_48H` / `NURTURE` / `DO_NOT_ENGAGE`

### Admin Prompt Editor — /admin/prompt
- Full textarea UI to edit the Claude prompt live
- 20 `{{variables}}` available (all form fields + IP data)
- Changes saved to Firestore `config/leadIntelligencePrompt`
- Firebase Function reads from Firestore on every submission
- Falls back to hardcoded default if Firestore unavailable
- Save/Reset to Default / last-saved timestamp shown
- Variable reference panel: click to insert at cursor

### reCAPTCHA Fixes
- Localhost bypass: requests from localhost skip reCAPTCHA entirely (always scores low in dev)
- Production threshold lowered 0.4 → 0.3 (still blocks bots at 0.1-0.2)
- Logic bug fixed: inverted if/else was blocking localhost instead of skipping it

### Contact Form Bug Fixes
- **Auto-submit bug**: `<form onSubmit>` replaced with plain `<div>` — Submit button is `type="button"` with `onClick`. Physically impossible to auto-submit now.
- **Step guard**: `handleSubmit` previously had no check for current step — could fire on Enter key from any step. Now only callable via explicit button click.
